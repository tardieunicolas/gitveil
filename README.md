# GitVeil

**Keep your GitHub contribution graph active without exposing your private code.**

## üÜï What's New in v1.0.4

> **[View Full Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)** 

## How To Use

1. Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and
   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine.
2. Install GitVeil globally:
   ```bash
   npm install git-veil -g
   ```
3. Create [a private repository](https://github.com/new) for your contribution activity (e.g., `my-activity`).
4. Setup your target repository:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-activity && cd my-activity
   git init
   git remote add origin git@github.com:<USERNAME>/my-activity.git
   git branch -M main
   gitveil config --init
   ```
5. Record and sync your activity:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/work/repo
   gitveil record
   gitveil push
   ```

**Done!** Now your GitHub graph reflects your private work.

## Main commands

- `gitveil record`: Extract and save filtered Git activity
- `gitveil status`: Show sync status and pending record
- `gitveil push`: Push anonymized commits to GitHub
- `gitveil config --init`: Edit configuration (email, path, etc)
- `gitveil guide`: Show quick start guide


## How It Works

1. **Scan**: Reads commit dates from your repositories (no code access)
2. **Generate**: Creates anonymous commits in your target repository
3. **Sync**: Pushes to GitHub to update your contribution graph

**Privacy Guarantee**: Only commit timestamps are processed - your code never leaves your machine, no network access to your professional repositories.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Is my code safe?**  
A: Yes. GitVeil only reads commit timestamps, never your source code.

**Q: Can I use multiple repositories?**  
A: Yes. Run `gitveil record` in each repository you want to track.

**Q: Will it affect my work repositories?**  
A: No. GitVeil is read-only for your work repos.

**Q: What if I miss some days?**  
A: Run `gitveil record && gitveil push` - original dates are preserved.

**Q: Can I preview before pushing?**  
A: Yes. Use `gitveil status` to see pending commits.

**Q: How does email detection work?**  
A: Uses `git config user.email` from each repository automatically.
